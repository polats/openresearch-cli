//! Native modular agent skills for `orx`.
//!
//! The monolithic `orx skill` overview (repo-root `SKILL.md`) is factored into a
//! handful of focused modules that live as **literal, complete skill files** in
//! the repo `agent-skills/` directory (`agent-skills/<name>/SKILL.md`,
//! frontmatter included — readable as-is on GitHub) and are embedded in the
//! binary at compile time and installed verbatim. Two consumers use them:
//!
//! * **Local `orx up` sessions** get the [`SkillSet::Local`] modules written as
//!   native `SKILL.md` skill dirs *into the session worktree* — fresh on every
//!   turn, right beside the playbook (see [`ensure_session_skills`]). The harness
//!   picks the skills subdir (`.claude/skills`, `.opencode/skills`,
//!   `.agents/skills`), so the session's own agent auto-discovers them and never
//!   sees drift.
//! * **`orx skill <name>`** resolves a bundled module (with or without the
//!   `orx-` prefix) from the set matching its context — the Local set inside an
//!   `orx up` session, the Full set otherwise — and prints it; the no-arg
//!   overview lists that same set. `orx install-skills --full` writes the Full
//!   set into an agent's global skills dir (the dedicated cloud box).
//!
//! The two sets share the same public skill *names* so docs and references stay
//! stable; several modules swap their **body** between a local-mode form
//! (backend-based launches, logs-only evidence, files-dir reports, worktree
//! git flow) and a full/cloud form (managed-SKU compute, artifacts + query +
//! chart, `orx report` upload). The `orx-` prefix on every dir name makes them
//! unmistakable in an agent's skill listing.
