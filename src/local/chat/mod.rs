//! Unified chat layer for `orx up` — one session/message model over three
//! harness adapters (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode), each a local child
//! process using the user's own login. orx's SQLite is the system of record
//! for transcripts; each harness keeps its native session for context/resume.
//!
//! Flow: `POST /api/chat/sessions/{id}/message` → `ChatHost::send_message`
//! persists the user message and spawns one turn task. The adapter streams
//! normalized parts into the per-turn assistant message; every flush persists
//! the message and broadcasts it as a `chat.message` SSE event.
