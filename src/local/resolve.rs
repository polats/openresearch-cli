//! Control-plane resolver — the single place that answers "does this id belong
//! to the local store or the server (cloud) api?".
//!
//! The detection rule is documented in `local/mod.rs`: an experiment/run is
//! "local" iff its experiment id exists in `local_experiments`. Every dual-mode
//! and reject-guard command dispatches through here so the rule lives in one
//! place. `resolve_project` keys on `local_projects`, `resolve_experiment` on
//! `local_experiments`. Note that store membership alone is NOT enough for runs
//! — server-mode HF runs also live in the `runs` table — so `resolve_run` reuses
//! the existing `local::local_run` correctness test rather than re-deriving it.
