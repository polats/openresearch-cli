//! The harness compatibility layer: one `Harness` trait that every coding-agent
//! integration (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor) implements, plus the
//! single `registry()` that every consumer iterates.
//!
//! A harness can offer up to three capabilities, and no harness is required to
//! offer all of them:
//!
//! * **detection** (`detect`) — is the CLI installed, is the user signed in,
//!   which account/models. Powers `orx up`'s harness picker.
//! * **chat** (`run_turn`) — drive one chat turn by spawning the CLI and
//!   normalizing its native event stream into wire parts. Detection-only or
//!   install-only harnesses leave this at its default (unsupported).
//! * **skill install** (`skill_target` / `skill_shim`) — drop the `orx` skill
//!   shim so the agent auto-discovers the CLI. Cursor offers only this.
//!
//! Adding a fourth harness is one new file with one `impl Harness` and one line
//! in `registry()`; the dispatch, the ID list, the detection sweep, and the
//! skill installer all pick it up with no further edits.

description: Drive automated ML research on OpenResearch with the `orx` CLI — create experiments, launch and monitor runs on GPU compute, analyze results and logs, query the evidence DB, and search literature. Use whenever the user wants to understand, explain, explore, or work on an OpenResearch project, run experiments, do auto-research, or mentions orx or OpenResearch.

# OpenResearch (`orx`)

You drive OpenResearch through the `orx` command-line tool. The authoritative
operating manual lives inside the CLI and changes often, so **load it fresh at the
start of every session** instead of relying on this file or prior memory.

## 1. Load the live guide

```bash
orx skill
```

This prints the current manual — the cardinal rules and a command
quick-reference — followed by a **live index of modules**. Read it before taking
any action. For the detail on a specific area, run `orx skill <name>` to print
that module (e.g. `orx skill experiment-tree`, `orx skill compute`); the same
command fetches deeper API-served references by the paths listed at the end of
the output.

## 2. Carry out the user's research goal

Follow the auto-research loop from the guide: create the baseline experiment
first when the project is empty, branch variants off it, fill the user's available
GPU capacity with useful parallel runs, wait on completions, and analyze each result before deciding
to repair, refill, promote, or stop.

## Prerequisite

The user must be logged in. If any command reports `Not logged in`, ask them to
run `orx login`.
"#;

/// Legacy Codex prompt (`~/.codex/prompts/orx.md`), invoked as `/orx`. Codex now
/// reads native SKILL.md skills (`~/.agents/skills/`, gets `CLAUDE_SKILL`); this
/// prompt is still written alongside for older codex versions that don't.
/// Plain markdown for broad version compatibility; `$ARGUMENTS` is substituted
/// with whatever the user types after the command (and reads fine as-is if their
/// Codex doesn't expand it).
pub(super) const CODEX_PROMPT: &str = r#"Drive automated ML research on OpenResearch using the `orx` CLI.

Start by running `orx skill` to load the current operating manual — the cardinal
rules, a command quick-reference, and a live index of modules. It changes often,
so always read it fresh rather than relying on memory or a cached copy. Pull up a
module's detail with `orx skill <name>` (e.g. `orx skill experiment-tree`,
`orx skill compute`).

Then carry out the user's research goal, following the auto-research loop from that
guide: create the baseline experiment first when the project is empty, branch
variants off it, fill the available GPU capacity with useful parallel runs, wait on completions, and
analyze each result before deciding to repair, refill, promote, or stop.

If any command reports `Not logged in`, ask the user to run `orx login` first.
