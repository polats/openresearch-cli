//! Claude plan-mode gate for read-only shell commands.
//!
//! Claude Code's `--permission-mode plan` auto-approves its built-in read-only
//! tools (file reads, `grep`, …) but treats an arbitrary `Bash(orx …)` as a
//! write it must gate — and headless `--print` can't answer that prompt, so the
//! call just fails. That breaks planning, because the agent plans by
//! *inspecting* prior runs, logs, and the evidence DB via read-only `orx`
//! subcommands — and by reading experiment code that often lives only on git
//! branches (`git show <ref>:<file>`, `git ls-tree`), typically piped through
//! `head`/`grep` with a `2>&1`.
//!
//! The fix is a `PreToolUse` hook (wired only in plan mode — see
//! `claude::write_plan_settings`) that runs `orx plan-gate`: it reads the hook's
//! JSON off stdin, and if the tool is a Bash call invoking a *read-only*
//! command it prints an `"allow"` decision so the command runs. For anything
//! else — a write/launch `orx` verb (`exp run`, `instance`, `create-*`, …), a
//! git write, an unknown program, or an unparseable command — it stays silent
//! (exit 0, no stdout), so plan mode's normal gating applies and launches
//! remain blocked until the user approves the plan.
//!
//! Classification is deliberately *allowlist-only*: an unknown or ambiguous
//! command is treated as NOT read-only (gated), so a newly added write verb
//! can never leak through by default. The flip side is a maintenance
//! obligation: the `orx` allowlist is a hand-kept mirror of the read-only
//! verbs in `main.rs`'s `Command` enum. A newly added *read* verb stays gated
//! until it's added here — `readonly_verbs_are_real_commands` guards against a
//! rename silently un-gating nothing, but adding a new read verb is a manual
//! step (there's a pointer comment on the `Command` enum).
