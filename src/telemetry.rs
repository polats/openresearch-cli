//! Anonymous, opt-out usage analytics → PostHog.
//!
//! Why this exists: `orx` shipped with no telemetry, so we had no way to see
//! installs, DAU/WAU, retention, or which commands people actually use. This
//! module sends anonymous events (a random per-install UUID as the only
//! identity — never any PII, prompt text, file paths, ids, or repo contents).
//!
//! Guarantees, enforced by this module:
//! - **Opt-out.** A `--no-telemetry` flag and a persistent `orx telemetry off`
//!   (also toggleable from the `orx up` onboarding step). A disabled run sends
//!   nothing, touches no disk, and generates no install id. (Sole exception:
//!   *agreeing* to the consent step persists the install id — an opt-in; see
//!   `record_consent`.)
//! - **Never blocks or crashes the CLI.** Sends are fire-and-forget on a
//!   background task with a bounded flush window (modeled on
//!   [`crate::updates::UpdateWarning`]); every error is swallowed. A telemetry
//!   fn returning to a command's `?` chain is impossible — they all return `()`.
//! - **musl-safe.** Reuses a rustls `reqwest` client; adds no TLS/C dependency.
