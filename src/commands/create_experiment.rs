//!
//! Creates an experiment node. Shapes, picked by flags:
//!   --parent <id>   -> child experiment branched off that parent
//!   --baseline      -> a new baseline (root), even when roots already exist —
//!                      projects may hold multiple baselines
//!   (no flags)      -> the oldest project root when one exists (local
//!                      projects), or the baseline (root) when the tree is
//!                      empty — projects start with no experiments, so the
//!                      first create is the baseline: the control its
//!                      variants are measured against
//! A title is always required.
//!
//! Note: the repo a project works on is chosen when the PROJECT is created
//! (`orx create-project` or the web), not here — so there is no `--repo` flag.
//! The baseline is materialized on whatever repo the project is already bound to.
