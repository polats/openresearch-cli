//! Command modules.
//!
//! Convention (every command author MUST follow this):
//!
//!   pub async fn run(args: crate::<Args>) -> crate::error::Result<()>
//!
//! - The arg struct is the clap-derive `Args` type defined in `main.rs` for that
//!   command (e.g. `crate::ProjectsArgs`). It is moved in by value.
//! - The fn loads credentials itself via `crate::error::require_credentials().await`
//!   (which exits 1 with "Not logged in..." when absent) — mirroring the TS, where
//!   each command calls `requireCredentials()`. `login`/`logout` do NOT require
//!   creds; `skill` uses `load_credentials` for best-effort behavior.
//! - Return `Ok(())` on success; propagate errors with `?`. `main` prints the
//!   error and exits 1.
//! - For early-exit "usage" errors that the TS prints to stderr + exit(1),
//!   return `Err(anyhow!(...))` (clap already enforces required positionals, so
//!   most of those usage guards are unnecessary in the Rust port).
