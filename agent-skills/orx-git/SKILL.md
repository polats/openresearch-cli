name: orx-git
description: "Read, edit, and diff a node's code with plain git: sync, commit, and push before running. Use whenever you touch experiment code — before editing any branch, when a checkout or push fails, when comparing two nodes' code, or when a run seems to have picked up stale code."
---

Every experiment node **is a git branch** (`orx/<slug>`) on the project's GitHub
repo — `orx create-experiment` prints it. You interface with code through plain
git and your own tools.

## In a local `orx up` session (the usual case): work in your cwd, and ONLY your cwd

You are **already inside a private git worktree** of the project repo — your
current directory. Do everything here: `git fetch origin && git checkout <branch>`,
edit, commit, push. This worktree is yours alone.

**NEVER `cd` into or write to `~/.cache/openresearch/repos/<owner>/<repo>`** — that
is the shared **hub clone** that *every* session's worktree is derived from.
Checking out a branch or dropping files there corrupts other agents' checkouts and
can leave a branch locked to the hub. If a `git checkout <branch>` in your worktree
fails with "already used by worktree", another session owns that branch — pick a
different node, don't go hunting in the cache dir. Stay in `$PWD`.

## Outside a live session (cloud / full-set contexts only)

There, clone into the openresearch cache dir (keyed by repo, reused across a
project's experiments), **never** your cwd or `~/projects`:

```
~/.cache/openresearch/repos/<owner>/<repo>
```

`<owner>/<repo>` comes from `orx projects`.

This is how you **realize a child's hypothesis**: after `create-experiment
--parent`, check out the child's branch and make the specific code/config edits
its description calls for — then commit, push, and run. Edit only the files that
idea touches, and **don't touch the run command** (it's inherited; see the
`orx-experiment-tree` skill). Edit children, never the baseline.

The sync recipe is **idempotent** — run it verbatim whether or not the clone
already exists from a previous session. Always fetch + reset before editing, so a
reused clone is never stale (and the experiment's branch, created server-side, is
fetched even when it's brand-new and not in your local clone yet):

```sh
DIR=~/.cache/openresearch/repos/<owner>/<repo>

# Clone once (skips if it already exists), then ALWAYS sync before touching a branch:
[ -d "$DIR" ] || git clone https://github.com/<owner>/<repo> "$DIR"
git -C "$DIR" fetch origin
git -C "$DIR" checkout -B orx/<slug> origin/orx/<slug>   # create, or reset to origin if it exists

#   …edit files under "$DIR" with your normal tools…
git -C "$DIR" commit -am "tune lr"     # one or more commits — your call
git -C "$DIR" push                     # push so runs and the tree see the change
```

Rules and notes:
- **Always sync first.** `git -C "$DIR" fetch origin && git -C "$DIR" checkout -B
  orx/<slug> origin/orx/<slug>` is mandatory every time — `-B …origin` creates the
  branch or resets an existing local one to the GitHub tip, so a persistent clone
  never edits a stale base. It discards uncommitted/unpushed local work on that
  branch, which is exactly what you don't want to carry across sessions (the
  contract is commit + push before moving on).
- **Auth is your own git.** Clone/push use whatever GitHub credentials your `git`
  already has — the repo lives under your account or your org, so access is the
  same as any of your repos. If a clone or push fails on auth, authenticate git
  for github.com (e.g. `gh auth login` or an SSH key) and retry.
- **Push before you run.** `orx exp run` launches from the branch's pushed tip on
  GitHub — uncommitted or unpushed edits won't be in the run. Commit and push
  first.
- **Never merge or rebase a branch that has a completed non-failed run** (cardinal
  rule): its history is the code those results came from. To bring in changes
  from another branch, create a **child** experiment and put the merge commit on
  the child's branch. And never rebase, anywhere — the tree records what actually
  ran, and rewriting history makes no sense in an experiment tree.
- **Reading another node's code** without disturbing your checkout: that branch is
  already in the clone after a fetch — `git -C "$DIR" show origin/orx/<slug>:<path>`.

## Code diffs — local git

What did a run change vs. its parent experiment? `orx exp status <expId>` prints
the parent's branch, the latest run's full commit SHA, and this exact recipe —
compute the diff locally in the same clone:

```sh
DIR=~/.cache/openresearch/repos/<owner>/<repo>   # owner/repo from `orx projects`
[ -d "$DIR" ] || git clone https://github.com/<owner>/<repo> "$DIR"   # cold cache → clone first
git -C "$DIR" fetch origin                        # ALWAYS fetch first — the commit and parent tip live on GitHub
git -C "$DIR" diff origin/<parent-branch>...<full-commit-sha>
```

- The **three-dot** form diffs from the merge-base — what the run's branch
  changed, not what the parent gained since the fork. That's the cumulative
  "what this experiment did to the code" view.
- Fetch first is mandatory: the run's commit and the parent's tip exist on
  GitHub and may not be in your clone yet.
- Root experiments have no parent — there is no diff base, by definition.
